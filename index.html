## Abstract
<div align="justify">
In sport analysis, the information of ball trajectories is useful for evaluating game strategies and players' performance. Many vision-based object tracking techniques have been developed to analyze sport videos. However, in certain sports such as tennis and badminton, balls are not only small but fast, resulting in tiny and blurry images in the video. Trajectory tracking task beomces  challenging and multiple high frame rate and high resolution cameras are necessary to mitigate the problem. This work proposed a heatmap-based deep learning network called TrackNet to achieve precise ball tracking task on low cost videos. Detection heatmaps are generated from consecutive frames to locate the ball and learn its physical behavior. To assess the proposed TrackNet, a tennis dataset collected from the competition of men’s singles final at the 2017 Summer Universiade is analyzed. Conventional image processing algorithm is also implemented to compare with the TrackNet. Our experiments indicate that TrackNet outperforms conventaional method by a big margin and achieves exceptional ball tracking performance. The Precision, Recall, and F1-measure of TrackNet reach 99.7%, 97.3%, and 98.5%, respectively.
